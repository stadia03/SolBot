# SolBot üöÄ  
A bot that simplifies transactions on the Solana blockchain by signing transactions on behalf of users. With SolBot, users can send SOL effortlessly without manually signing transactions every time.

---

## Features ‚ú®
- **Keyless Transactions**: SolBot signs transactions programmatically, removing the need for users to manage private keys manually.
- **Secure Signing**: Transactions are authorized securely with user authentication mechanisms.
- **Effortless SOL Transfers**: Send SOL directly from the app without interacting with external wallets.
- **Public Key Management**: Automatically derives and displays your public key for easy access.

---

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
1. **Authentication**:  
   Users are authenticated with a token (e.g., JWT) and linked to their unique account.

2. **Transaction Signing**:  
   SolBot uses the user‚Äôs private key to:
   - Derive the public key.
   - Sign transactions programmatically.
   - Submit transactions to the Solana blockchain.

3. **Integration**:  
   Client communicates with SolBot‚Äôs backend API to create, sign, and broadcast transactions.
